Don’t search for happiness in a place where you will not find it. Know that true happiness comes from Him and it lasts forever.\n', 'Sometimes the Almighty sends you blessings disguised in what you see as ugly packages. He wants to see your response. Will you give thanks &amp; embrace the whole process or judge it at face value &amp; react adversely to it? Don’t lose the plot. Don’t let Satan make you ungrateful!\n', 'The trials that come your way can make you better or bitter. They can make you grow up or give up. The Almighty’s watching your response. Have you got what it takes to go through tough trials? Will you bear good patience with a soft heart or will your heart harden in the process?\n', 'Do you keep going round in circles? Do you feel like you’re moving but not making any progress? Then you have to stop doing what you’re doing &amp; take stock of your life. Reevaluate your priorities &amp; shift your mindset. Get out of the rut. Seek your strength from the Almighty.\n', 'Don’t let your fears and worries crush you. Never feel alone in your internal panic. The Almighty knows every single thing about you. Keep asking Him. Keep confiding in Him. Let go of the worry that’s gripping you. Let Him take over and feel a sense of calm restored in you!\n', 'What is this life but a series of obstacles? The good news is nothing happens without the Almighty’s Will. If anything unpleasant comes into your life, it had to get approval from Him. He knows the kind of test you need. He’s placed a blessing inside of it. It’s for your good!\n', 'Life can be difficult if all you see is everything that’s wrong. Start focusing on what’s right, what’s good, what’s constructive. No matter what you’re facing, if you choose a positive mindset, you’ll emerge the winner. So if you want to feel better, you’ve got to think better!\n', 'Stop investing in your past. It’s over. Let it go. The Almighty has paved a way for you to move forward. Don’t be so engrossed with what was &amp; what has been that you forget to acknowledge His Blessing for what is &amp; what’s to come. Read the signs &amp; make that change to your life!\n', 'Learn to be at peace with what the Almighty has chosen for you. If we allow that peace to reign in our hearts, our worldly stresses will dissipate &amp; disappear. Don’t allow unanswered prayers for the moment to cause anger or bitterness. He has the best answer &amp; solution always!\n', 'Are you always unhappy &amp; discontented with life? If you are check yourself for these symptoms. Are you always criticising others; complaining that your life isn’t good enough; quick to condemn people or comparing yourself with your neighbours? Stop all that &amp; feel the difference!\n', 'Almighty. Grant us tranquility &amp; hope in this pandemic that seems far from over. Many are confused &amp; helpless as nations go back into lockdown. Keep us thankful always as many are suffering a lot more than us. We ask You for beautiful patience to endure what lies ahead. Aameen!\n', 'Alimighty. Help us get rid of jealousy &amp; envy from our hearts. They’re the cause of many of today’s woes. Help us understand that envy eats &amp; rots the heart. Forgive us when we grumble how You bless others. Help us avoid comparison &amp; learn to be at peace with Your Blessings.\n', 'Anger is a choice. We can choose to retreat into our own minds and calm down or we can explode. Anger takes a lot of energy. Fighting, using derogatory words and showing acts of violence don’t solve any problem. Instead, take a step back, rationalise and seek the Almighty’s help!\n', 'When you have a grateful heart, you have everything. You acknowledge the goodness in your life. The Almighty will grant you more. He will increase your sustenance; ease your affairs; open doors you never thought possible. He will make you feel abundant rather than deprived!\n', 'Don’t expect everyone to react the way you do when confronted with a difficult situation. Remember, we have all been brought up differently and have different life experiences. This will determine our reaction to various situations. So be kind always and remember we all struggle!\n', 'We are humans and we are prone to mistakes and sins. Never mind how many times you’ve sinned but the biggest mistake is to lose hope in the Almighty’s Mercy. Keep repenting. Keep turning back to Him. Always believe that He will forgive you. This is what sets us apart from Satan!\n', 'People expect instant miracles everyday. Not everything in life is like that. You have to go through a process. We have become impatient when supplicating, expecting instant response. The Almighty doesn’t work like that. We need to learn patience, live a life of gratitude.\n', 'Avoid suspicion. It’s a trait of Satan and detested by the Almighty. It stems from a heart that is insecure and always full of doubt. At its worst, it can turn into hate; harming people and destroying relationships. Counter it with optimism, positive thoughts and firm faith!\n', 'Life is indeed a journey. Successful is he who can navigate the ups and downs without losing his balance. Don’t dwell on your past, don’t wallow in self-pity, don’t repeat your mistakes, don’t focus on negativity, help others along the way, spread kindness wherever you go!\n', 'Do good, even what you consider to be insignificant acts. The Almighty sees, hears &amp; knows everything. He will reward you for it. Remember unlike humans, He’s above glitches, errors &amp; system failures. He is perfect but He doesn’t expect perfection from us. Only sincere effort!\n']",,Mufti Menk ,muftimenk ,Zimbabwe ,Sat Feb 05 07:57:28 +0000 2011 ,Zimbabwe ,6510640 ,1 ,8 ,,
